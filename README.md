## Local Setup

1) Download and install conda
    Probably from https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html, if you don't already have it.
2) Create the Deliberate Practice conda environment
    Likely with the following command in a CLI "conda env create --file deliberate_practice.yml"
3) If desired, set the environment variable DELIBERATE_PRACTICE_CONDA_DIR to the newly created conda directory
    This can be used by Sublime to find the python executable to run, if desired
